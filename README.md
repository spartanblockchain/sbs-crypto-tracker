# Crypto Tracker

## What it does
Our crypto tracker is a GUI for visualizing the history of cryptocurrencies over certain periods of time (currently only supports Bitcoin).

## Why is it important?
It is a great interactive piece of software that will be outward facing allowing people who visit our site to see something they're familiar with.  It will be a great connector for tying together cryptocurrencies and blockchain on the SBS site.


### How to run
1. terminal command to start up the server and connect to database: 
`npm run dev`
2. Open `localhost:8000` in any browser to view the chart
